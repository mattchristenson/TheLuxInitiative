After having been speaking and brainstorming this project for some time now, 
and having numerous notes written on graph paper, numerous discussions, and 
having purchased thousands of dollars of electronics to experiment, I begin
what I have dubbed the lux initiative.

Created website, looked at PluralSite to find tutorials on OAuth and ASP.NET, 
I will watch those tutorials and decide how to proceed.  Not having created a 
website from scratch in some number of years, I still have a lot of decisions
to make about the architectures that I will chose.
